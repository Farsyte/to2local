# to2local

This is an image of the directory where I keep my scripts
for the KontrolSystem2 addon for Kerbal Space Program 2.

To use these scripts, you can either clone this repo into

    <GameRoot>/BepInEx/plugins/KontrolSystem2/to2Local

or you can place it somewhere more convenient to you, then put the
path to where you stored it in

    <GameRoot>/BepInEx/config/com.github.untoldwind.KontrolSystem2.cfg
