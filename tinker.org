Current Behavior of tinker.to2

My intention is to commit updates to this document alongside changes
to the tinker script, capturing the current status of the experiment.

Kerbal Space Program 2 Patch Two has dropped, and I am
installing Kontrol System 2 version 0.3.3 as I write this.

I have moved all of the scripting from before away (into
a subdirectiory) and will be rebuilding from the ground
up with recent changes to both KSP2 and KS2 in mind.

As before, I am drivig toward being able to automate many
mission phases in a way that allows them to be chunked
together into simple "fire and forget" automation for all
automatable aspects of a range of missions.
